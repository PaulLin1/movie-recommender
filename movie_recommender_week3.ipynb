Basically, numpy is a library that gives you more ways to interact with data. Think of the prebuilt sum function in Python. Instead having to sum through the values of a list yourself, you can just call the sum function. Numpy is similar, but it gives you access to more powerful functions. Pandas is a tool for organizing data. Instead of sum functions that perform actions using the data, it helps with rearranging and indexing it in interesting ways. You'll see how they are used as we progress through the notebook."
